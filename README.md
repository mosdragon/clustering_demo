## Color Quantization Using K-Means Clustering
Use the K-Means Clustering algorithm to recolor an image using only _k_ colors.

## Dependencies
You will need the following python libraries:
- numpy
- scipy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

Install them all via `pip`:
```bash
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## To Run
Run `python script.py` in a terminal.

## To Change Images
In _script.py_, simply change the _filename_ and _outname_ string literals from `newfoundland` to whichever file you are looking to recolor.
